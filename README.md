# Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Budget Tracker - Challenge 19

## Description
This project is the nineteenth challenge of the coding bootcamp.

User Story: As an avid traveler I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

Starting from starter code, this challenge required writing additional code to do the following:
*   GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection

        - WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
        - THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit

        - WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
        - THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
